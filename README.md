## Introduction

As a DevSecOps professional, I have extensive experience integrating security practices within the DevOps workflow. My expertise covers the main areas of DevSecOps, utilizing a wide range of tools across development, security, and operations.

My main roles were developed in short working periods proving my previously gained experience since I was 6 years old having fun with compute scraps from my parents office and creating services an products both with Gentoo in my own dojos (clusters made from playstations 3's to raspberry ones and other architecture based ones). I created a primitive Nas with gentoo, distributed crosscompiling environments for provisioning binary packages for gentoo in other architectures like the slurm based playstation 3 supercomputer or the raspberry pi kubernetes with ethereum blockchain deployed in separated services. I Have a TOEIC B2 certification since 2018 in english(Not a C1 because of poor examination equipment in TOEIC and 15 points in between a graduation in between 0 to 1000 points) and I've been learning it since searching in google from 1999 for technical documentation. Also I have a high scored but not passed CISCO certification, and a passed LPIC-1 one (Not pressented to LPIC-2 due COVID and scheduling issues) but all in all let's go to the DevSecOps official experience:

## My registered working experience:

It's based in 3 contracts, 2 for consultory enterprises and a third one grown as intern in the "Universidad de León" inside a robotics research group which made ODIN (https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-B-2021-49082) that was a very interesting for me and I developed on minimal wage during while changing in between underpaid HPE/CDS experience and AGAP2/Acciona one.

 1. HPE/CDS contract: Started by betting 10€ in me to try a HPE/CDS bootcamp to prove my parents I would work from home with my computers one day (My parents told me as a child that it would be impossible). Got the job offer 3 days after starting correctly appointing some corrections to the teachers of the bootcamp and just needed a proof of my speaking english skills. Then I was interviewed by the HPE automation engineer for technical knowledge in ansible. I asked for grown in the field of kubernetes and my good work during the onboarding did the rest to end up almost 2 years in an underpaid (26K) possition which brought me to hessitation and changing to AGAP2 (42K) with Acciona as client working in ODIN in the meantime.

 2. Universidad de León/Robotics Research Group/ODIN: As my teachers at university realized that I passed 10 subjects with notes between 9 and 10 (with 6 of em graduated with honours) they started offering me non paid possitions as researcher in labs where I did lots of things related to IoT and ended up working for 2 of them; SECOMUCI (Security over networks and IoT fields where I did a study to crawl and sink botnets with a raspberry pi docker swarm cluster lab and WPA3 research and exploitation); and The Robotics Research group where I did a lot of things and gaining my possition as architect of de DevSecOps and Software development PaaS so called 'ODIN'. I did it under SMI wage but all in all was fun and opened the gates to public cloud that HPE was not working on because they monolithic software was delivered as a product in a DVD (yes, helm in an .iso file), and the RnD section I was working had only 3 clients which were using our products in production. But all in all, they were the main clients of the company and as I said I had a lot of resposability for an absurd wage.

 3. AGAP2/Acciona: As AGAP2 was expanding from France to Barcelona and Madrid they started offering good paid possitions to work within new remote cloud contexts as DevOps engineer. When I got into Acciona's project there was all a mess because I was entering to cover a parental leave of the person in charge from Acciona DevOps (Acciona has a lot of mini sections, and sub enterprises) and the person covering the work into the new Acciona CECOC (The one I was working on) was trying to cope with 4 lines of software production (yes, like in jurassic park, Acciona does not espare on expense, but hires just one junior DevOps engineer) and he created just one cluster in GKE to migrate all the AWS services into GKE, therefore I helped em to have a landing zone in terraform to start sparsing proyects and organizing them properly. The AzureDevOps was a mess too. The production lines where not sharing properly their knowledge into confluence and a large amount of copy/pasted code with moked testing to surpass AzureDevops Pipelines. Also their Sonarqube reports where separated from the CI/CD when AzureDevOps had it's own SonarLint plugin and SonarQube plugin to approve PullRequests because the testing was made manually and not regresive and automated. Working with em was easy at the begining because I joined on summer time so I had time for both projects but then it was more time than expected because of covering out of work non-paid guards (things of having tbms making tunnels under Brazilian or Canadian time schedule) gained my points but after losing a dog and a train to Madrid and working with headaches for 3 days, my boss which was non related IT person decided to retire 5 days of my salary for low performing (I had a back muscular injury that brought me the headaches). One of the days was a free day in León so he was more evidently erroneus. All in all the other worker that was coping with the DevOps line with me for the already 5 lines of software production had a contract with AGAP2 too, so I decided to not apply law enforcement over the situation and AGAP2 keept my profile, but I already had to leave ODIN's project 2 months before project delivery due this Accionas time scheduling and because I can't gave more of myself. Agap2 kept my profile and tryed to give me some more time to adapt to new projects, but I was devastated for my dogs loss, the situation of leaving ODIN's project before project delivery and the possitions Agap2 offered didn't motivate me so they decided to fire me and I decided to take a time to learn again a enjoy more free time.
